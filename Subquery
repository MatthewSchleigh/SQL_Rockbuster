Write a subquery to determine how many of top 5 customers are in the top 10 countries.

/* JOIN variables from 'country' table with 'payment' table in subquery */

    COUNT (DISTINCT d.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, 
    COUNT (DISTINCT a.country) AS top_customer_count
  FROM country A
  INNER JOIN city B ON A.country_id=B.country_id
  INNER JOIN address C ON B.city_id=C.city_id
  INNER JOIN customer D ON C.address_id=D.address_id 
  INNER JOIN payment E ON D.customer_id=E.customer_id
