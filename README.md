# SQL_Rockbuster
SQL queries from Rockbuster project in CareerFoundry Data Analytics Course

As a component of CareerFoundryâ€™s Data Analytics program, 
  I was tasked to develop my analysis using statistical and descriptive techniques, 
  as well as demonstrating a proficiency SQL and Tableau. 
  Rockbuster Stealth is a fictional company, whose data has been supplied by CareerFoundry.

In preparation for an annual company strategy meeting, I was tasked to answer the following questions:
  1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
  5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

PostgreSQL was used to perform data queries.
The data set contains multiple tables containing observations pertaining to 
  customers, payments, rentals, employees, stores, films, and inventories, among other variables.
  
Tableau was used to visualize results of my analysis.
