### **Objectives:** 
  1. Develop an analysis through statistical and descriptive techniques
  2. Demonstrate a proficiency with SQL and Tableau. 
  

### **Scenario:**
In preparation for an annual company strategy meeting, I was tasked to answer the following questions:
  1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
  5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?


The data set contains multiple tables containing observations pertaining to 
  customers, payments, rentals, employees, stores, films, and inventories, among other variables.

### **PostgreSQL** was used to perform data queries.
### **Tableau** was used to visualize results of my analysis.
