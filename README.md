*Rockbuster Stealth is a fictional company, whose data has been supplied by CareerFoundry.*

**Scenario:**
In preparation for an annual company strategy meeting, I was tasked to answer the following questions:
  1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
  5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

**PostgreSQL** was used to perform data queries.
The data set contains multiple tables containing observations pertaining to 
  customers, payments, rentals, employees, stores, films, and inventories, among other variables.
  
**Tableau** was used to visualize results of my analysis.
